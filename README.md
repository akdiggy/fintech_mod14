# Challenge 14 Algorithmic Trading and Machine Learning

In a Jupyter notebook, the following will be done:

* Implement an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions.

* Adjust the input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm.

* Train a new machine learning model and compare its performance to that of a baseline model.

A report is shown below that compares the performance of the machine learning models based on the trading predictions that each makes and the resulting cumulative strategy returns.
